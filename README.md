# Life_Expectancy

## Which factors are associated with longer life expectancy?
### Overview

This project aims to explore which factors contribute to longer life expectancy using the Quality of Governance (QoG) Basic data set. This data set consists of 350 variables across 195 countries. The link to download the dataset can be found here: https://www.gu.se/en/quality-government/qog-data/data-downloads/basic-dataset (Dahlberg et al., 2021).

Our initial research question was to explore associations between happiness scores and various factors using this dataset. However after an initial analysis, we discovered that there was insufficient data and using the Life Expectancy variable would be more informative for this project. The Office for National Statistics UK suggests that factors related to health, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, diet and physical exercise are large contributors to life expectancy (Office for National Statistics UK, 2017), yet other research would suggest that additional factors may be influential. Therefore, this project will be split into two parts. Firstly, we are interested in investigating potential contributors to life expectancy using the QoG dataset. Our second and main goal is to create a calculator, using a multiple regression model, to predict how changing these different variables influence life expectancy.
